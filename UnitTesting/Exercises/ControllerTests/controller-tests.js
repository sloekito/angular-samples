/*
Create a unit test that contains a describe for verifying the methods in the 
ListController

    You should execute 3 tests
        One to verify that a team was deleted
        One to verify that a team was added
        One to verify that the restore works properly
        

REMEMBER - You will need to invoke your list controller and validate
your state against a test scope
